# Business Problem
As a marketing agency, our primary objective is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for 
our clients' advertising campaigns. We have conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and 
the other on AdWords, and we need to determine which platform yields better results in terms 
of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By identifying the most effective platform, 
we can allocate our resources more efficiently and optimize our advertising strategies to deliver 
better outcomes for our clients.
